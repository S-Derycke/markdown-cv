## Notable Projects

**MobilityPlus Api**

Designed and implemented backend architecture for a centralized MobilityPlus platform api. The api integrates with external services (e.g. Odoo, Optimile, Azure IoT Hub, Redis, ...) and provides role and permission based access control.

**JUUNOO Voltage**

Designed architecture and led development of cloud-based business digitalization solution.

**Ripe**

Expanded upon a production line scheduling system in Python Django to reduce cleaning time and increase production capacity by better planning for allergens on the line.
Used ant colony optimization to find optimal schedules.
Developed a web interface dashboard to visualize and interact with the schedules and integrated with production orders in external DB.

**Parcel Sorting Automation**

Designed and setup Computer Vision solution (using Azure services) to automate the parcel sorting process for the Latvian postal service.

**Hybrid Recommender Engine**

Data preparation, data enrichment and feature engineering on customer, restaurant, reservation and review data.

Designed, trained and evaluated a hybrid recommender engine that combines content-based and collaborative filtering techniques.

**Microservice System**

Migrated business logic from legacy Oracle system into Java Springboot microservices, communicating via Kafka (Azure Eventhubs), deployed on with kubernetes (AKS).

Helped design and implement microservice and messaging flow / architecture.

Ensured backwards compatibility and integration with legacy system during phase-out period.

**Master's Thesis - Reconstructing Natural Speech Features from EEG Data using Convolutional Neural Networks**

Designed, trained and evaluated a convolutional neural network that reconstructs the speech envelope. The model significantly outperformed the ridge regression based model that was in use at the Gasthuisberg hospital at the time.

This project was in collaboration with the research group of declarative languages and AI at computer science department of KU Leuven (DTAI) and the experimental oto-rino-larygnology research group at the neurosciences department of UZ Leuven (ExpORL).
